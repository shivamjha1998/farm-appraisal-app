## Understanding the Results
After a few seconds of analysis, the Result Screen will appear:

### 1. Identification Card
At the top, you will see the detected details:
* **Make**: The manufacturer (e.g., Kubota).
* **Model**: The specific model number.
* **Year**: Estimated year range.
* **Edit Button (Pencil Icon)**: If the AI made a mistake, tap this to manually correct the Make or Model and re-run the price search.

### 2. Market Value Estimate
This section shows the statistical breakdown of recent sales:
* **Median**: The middle price of all found listings (most reliable indicator).
* **Min / Max**: The lowest and highest sold prices found.

### 3. Price Filter
Use the slider to filter the listings below. For example, if you only want to see listings under ¥2,000,000, slide the knob to the left.

### 4. Comparable Listings
A scrollable list of actual sold items from Yahoo Auctions.
* Tap on any listing to open the original auction page in your browser for more details.

## Features

### Search History
You don't need to rescan the same tractor twice.
1.  Tap the **History Icon** (Clock) in the top-right corner of the Home Screen.
2.  Scroll through your list of past scans.
3.  Tap any item to view its saved appraisal results.

### Manual Search / Correction
If the AI cannot identify the equipment:
1.  Wait for the result screen (it may show "Unknown" or a low confidence warning).
2.  Tap the **Edit (Pencil)** icon on the Identification Card.
3.  Type the correct **Make** and **Model**.
4.  Tap **"Update Search"** to fetch new market prices manually.

## Troubleshooting
* **"Could not identify equipment"**: Try taking a closer photo specifically of the model number text on the side of the hood.
* **No Listings Found**: The model might be very new, very old, or rare. Try searching for a broader model series (e.g., search "L2500" instead of "L2501").
* **App crashes or network error**: Ensure your phone has an internet connection and the backend server is running.
